# Deep_Neural_Network_for_Image_Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the "Deep Neural Network for Image Classification" programming assignment, which is part of Week 4 in Course Neural Networks and Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai. The assignment involves building a cat/not-a-cat classifier using deep neural networks.

## Assignment Details
- **Due Date:** Feb 19, 2023
- **Assignment Type:** Programming
- **Course:** Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
- **Week:** Week 4

## Objectives
- By completing this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4 and also the last programming assignment of Course. Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network
- Apply the trained model to supervised learning tasks, specifically for image classification.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:
- PIL (Pillow) 8.2.0
- dnn_app_utils_v3 (NA)
- h5py 2.10.0
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- numpy 1.20.1
- scipy 1.5.4
- jupyter==1.0.0
