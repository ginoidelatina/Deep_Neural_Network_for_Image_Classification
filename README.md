# Deep_Neural_Network_for_Image_Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the "Deep Neural Network for Image Classification" programming assignment, which is part of Week 4 in Course Neural Networks and Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai. The assignment involves building a cat/not-a-cat classifier using deep neural networks.

## Assignment Details
- **Due Date:** Feb 19, 2023
- **Assignment Type:** Programming
- **Course:** Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
- **Week:** Week 4

## Objectives
- By completing this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4 and also the last programming assignment of Course. Upon completion, you should be able to:
   - Build and train a deep L-layer neural network
   - Apply the trained model to supervised learning tasks, specifically for image classification.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebook:
- **numpy**: `1.18.4`
- **matplotlib**: `3.2.1`
- **scikit-learn**: `0.22.2.post1`
- **scipy**: `1.4.1`

Additionally, you will need the following files and modules from your project:
- **reg_utils.py**
- **testCases.py**
- **public_tests.py**

## Session Information
The information below is specific to the session in which this project was tested:

- **Python**: `3.7.6`
- **IPython**: `7.14.0`
- **JupyterLab**: `2.1.1`

Make sure to adjust the installation instructions as needed, depending on the specific libraries your code requires.
